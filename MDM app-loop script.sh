#   - prompt_user_then_kill
#                  show a user dialog for each blocking process found,
#                  attempt to quit two times, kill the process finally

#                  Like prompt-user, but clicking "Not Now", will just wait an hour,

#   - tell_user    User will be showed a notification about the important update,
#                  but user is only allowed to quit and continue, and then we
#                  ask the app to quit.
#   - tell_user_then_kill
#                  Show dialog 2 times, and if the quitting fails, the

#   - kill         kill process without prompting or giving the user a chance to save
